                <p><b>Q. How was your first year at IITD?</b></p>
                <p>
                  I am from Noida, Delhi. It takes time to adjust. I wasn't able
                  to sleep the first day because of the humidity in a small
                  cramped room. The next day I bought a cooler. All in all, the
                  first year, I explored a plethora of activities, activities to
                  choose from. The first year I debated, and it was a fun
                  experience. You would meet many people and discuss a wide
                  variety of topics. The next year I switched to coding. Coding by
                  itself Requires dedication, and debates take up nearly 3 hours.
                  So I ended up leaving debating. My suggestion for the first
                  years is to explore a bit but keep your grade up because after
                  people mess up their grade, they end up spending their entire
                  time pushing their CG up later on. I did a project with IRSC
                  called the Helmet project in the summer after my first year. I
                  had a core role that required me to code and analyze the survey
                  results on helmet consumers. On what problems do they face, and
                  what features can be introduced to improve the product. In the
                  summer of my second year, I took up a deep learning internship
                  in a startup called autogenerate.ai, which I got after an
                  alumnus reached out to students on Whatsapp asking for summer
                  interns. I used to travel daily to Gurgaon and work till six and
                  party later with the team. It was an incredible experience for
                  me. I understood what ML was during the intern and had an
                  overall great time.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p><b>Q. Where did you intern in 3rd year?</b></p>
                <p>
                  You have to be good with data structures and practice on a site
                  I used interviewbit. You have puzzles and quants for analytics.
                  For internships, they do not consider your CV much as the
                  students aren't much. The reason why I got a shortlist was that
                  I had a high CG of 8.7, one deep learning internship, and basic
                  coding experience. After I got my analytics intern at Piramal
                  Enterprises, I used to chill at night, mess, and relax with my
                  friends. In my 6th semester, I wanted to explore consulting a
                  bit as I had already seen analytics and consulting. During the
                  semester, I was doing a semester internship that was related to
                  product management.

                    >Q. What were the resources that you used to prepare for
                    placements?</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  For DS interview bit. Brain stellar, and 50 challenging
                  questions in probability for Analytics. If you practice
                  thoroughly from these resources, you'll find that most of the
                  problems that come in interviews and tests are similar.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p><b>Q. 4th year shortlist and interview questions?</b></p>
                <p>
                  Shortlists are mostly CG based. Amazon straight away started
                  with DS questions and some OOPs concepts where I had to solve
                  them live. There were three interviews with increasing levels of
                  difficulties that I solved and no HR round. I also gave an
                  interview for Zomato where they asked query-based questions and
                  an easy data structure question. Because Zomato is a product
                  based company, they also asked questions on what kind of data
                  would you collect to gauge consumer preferences for specific
                  brands and etc.

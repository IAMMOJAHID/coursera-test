              <p style="width: 154%;">The rise of green and sustainable energy alternatives to meet the ever-increasing energy demands of the growing population has been fueled by global concern about climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels. To use the present energy resources “sustainably” we need to have efficient energy storage facilities. Among the available energy storage technologies, electronic rechargeable batteries are the most efficient ones with high conversion rates. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) Batteries (LIBs) are the most widely used batteries nowadays. But due to lithium metal’s high energy demand and sparse availability, Sodium Ion (Na-ion) Batteries (SIBs) are being considered as its replacement. The paper talks about understanding the design of different kinds of available cathode materials for such batteries and different ways of commercializing them . Basically there are three prime cathodic materials available for these sodium-ion batteries namely : Layered Transition Metal Oxides (LTMOs), Polyanions and Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs).  In general, LTMOs are sodium-based layered metal oxides which further exist in two major forms i.e. , P2(prismatic) and O3(octahedral). On the other hand polyanions are structures that are composed of two entities : polyhedra and anionic groups which, due to covalent bonding of oxygen with transition metal and non metallic species, possess high thermal stability compared to the other two. Apart from their advantages, the article also demonstrates how all these three materials posses some inefficacies which can be controlled to some extent by different processes such as Hetero-Atomic Doping, morphology control, surface modification and others. A good industrial comparison has also been done between all the available materials on the basis of scale-up viability, economic feasibility, storage stability, longevity and energy density. Talking about the future prospects, SIBs can affirmatively serve as a pragmatic option to develop large energy storage grid applications and can serve as the future of energy sustainability. </p>

              <p style="width: 154%;">The last century has been evident of the over-reliance of the human population over the conventional fossil fuels and environmental pollution owing to their excessive use . The growing environmental concerns and rapidly dwindling fossil reserves has led to a quest  to look for sustainable sources of clean energy. Lignin is a rich renewable source of aromatics present in lignocellulosic biomass (LCB). LCB present primarily in the plant cell walls, can be used as a potential substitute to the conventional fossil reserves. To achieve the maximum output of the LCB and for successful commercialization of sustainable biorefineries it is essential to extract and chemically transform lignin present in it  into valuable products. Lignin  is an attractive feedstock for obtaining value added products but the structural complexity of LCB is a major hindrance in its depolymerisation. Conventional approaches for extraction of lignin have either shown lower efficiency or chemical modification in structure during pretreatments.</p>
              <br>
              <p style="width: 154%;">Researchers recently came up with a method which involves development of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) for opening up new avenues in the area of lignin extraction and its subsequent valorisation. DESs are low melting solutions obtained as a result of mixing hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) with hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs) where they partially or completely dissolve lignin with high extraction efficacy. In this regard, the current study is aimed to use ChCl-carboxylic acid based eutectic mixtures in the treatment of coconut coir which has high lignin content. This lignin largely remains unused and hence is a source of large amounts of waste. A systematic investigation of the microwave-mediated use of different DESs in the extraction of lignin from this waste – coconut coir, in high yield and purity was done to improve the overall energy efficiency of the process. Further studies were performed to understand the effect of pretreatment time, temperature, and Hydrogen Bond Donors (HBDs) etc. This paper concludes with a practical approach towards effective pretreatment of coconut coir using DESs to extract high purity lignin.</p>

              <p style=" width: 154%">-Strano Lab, MIT (Michael S. Strano) </p>
              <p style="font-style: italic; width: 154%">“This could allow us to create ultrathin coatings that can completely prevent water or gases from getting through,” Strano says. </p>
              <p style="width: 154%;">The versatile usage of polymeric products has motivated scientists to create long-lasting, chemically resistant and strong polymers. It is found that unlike the long chain polymers (like long peptide chains), 2D sheet like structures can provide more strength and stability to polymers. We can attribute this fact to the naturally occurring structures like protein being folded into beta pleated sheets and alpha helices. In literature, these sheet-like 2D polymers are called covalently linked polymers (e.g. Graphite, (BN)x). Previous research on the development of 2D sheet like polymers has predicted that irreversible nucleophilic aromatic substitution and Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) can give chemical stability and mechanical strength to the polymers respectively. The main problem area in the fabrication of the 2D sheet like polymers is: As soon as the molecular disk or sheet polymerizes a branch grows out of the plane. That branch grows faster and it eventually results in 3D structure.</p>
              <br>
              <p style="width: 154%;">Researchers at MIT have hypothesised that strong amide-aromatic bonds can stop this undesired out of the plane branching. Another point to note is the fact that the inter-layer H-bond or van der waals bonds allow these growing discs or sheets to absorb more monomers from the solution and extend the 2D surface. The amide linkage provides superb mechanical and chemical stability to the 2D sheet polymers. Indeed this hypothesis turned out to be true. Researchers used melamine and C3- acyl chloride (C3 stands for 3 fold symmetric) as monomers to make these polymers. Because the material self-assembles in solution, it can be made in large quantities by simply increasing the quantity of the starting materials. The researchers showed that this material can be used as thin-film coatings on surfaces and is impermeable to air. Several post-production tests on the polymer revealed that the elastic modulus is six to eight times larger than that of bulletproof glass, and the density of the material is one-sixth that of steel.</p>
